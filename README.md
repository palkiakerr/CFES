# CFES - Classical Field Equation Solver
###### Theoretical Physics Group Programming Project

Note: You must have the Gnu Scientific Library (GSL) installed to compile CFES

Please follow the instructions below for the GUI.

    • The first entry determines the dimension of the matrix. Enter the desired dimension and number of iterations then click “Generate matrix”. As indicated on the button, this will overwrite the existing matrix, so only do this if a new system is being entered.

    • The second button determines the type of object being added. Please select one of the object types from the drop down button and click “Select option”. This will prompt the user for the relevant entries.
    • Add the relevant entries and click “Add object”.

    • Repeat the two previous steps as many times as is necessary.

    • Finally, click the “Generate Output!” button. This will open a pop-up window showing the Electric Field and the Potential of the system defined by the user. 

    •To reset everything including any generated images, close this window and type 'make clean' into the terminal.


Enjoy
